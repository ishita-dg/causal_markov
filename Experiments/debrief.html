1.	Reasoning about when events occur, and when they might cause other events or effects is ubiquitous in everyday life. Using tasks like the one you just completed, we are examining how people do such reasoning.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
2.	How was the study conducted? We have asked you to predict the probability of certain states of the world given the underlying causal structure. By isolating different variables that influence these probabilities, we can better understand how people reason about causes and effects in the real world.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
3.	What was the hypothesis? A fundamental goal of our research is to understand the cognitive factors that influence reasoning about cause and effect. We are studying these factors by presenting people with causal structures that vary in specific ways and seeing which factors make a difference.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
4.	Why is this study important? By comparing answers on these important factors, we learn about what factors affect reasoning about cause and effect. This has potential implications for public domains, such as healthcare policy and the justice system, where understanding the processes governing causal attribution (eg. did a health care policy reduce the risk of cancer, or does a jury beieve that a defendant caused harm) can lead to more psychologically effective policy.
