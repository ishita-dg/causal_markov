1.	What was this study about? Decision making is a ubiquitous aspect of life. Using tasks like the one you just completed, we are examining the factors that go into making a decision.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
2.	How was the study conducted? We have asked you to make choices between options. By isolating different variables that influence these decisions, we can better understand how people perform complex decision-making.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
3.	What was the hypothesis? A fundamental goal of our research is to understand the cognitive factors that influence decision-making. We are studying these factors by presenting people with choices that vary in specific ways and seeing which factors make a difference.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
4.	Why is this study important? By comparing answers on these important factors, we learn about what factors affect decision making. This has potential implications for public domains, such as healthcare policy and the justice system, where understanding the processes governing choice (e.g., of insurance, medical care, illegal substances) can lead to more psychologically effective public policy.
