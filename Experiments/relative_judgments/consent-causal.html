	<p style='text-align:center;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'><b>Study Consent</b></p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
		Please read this consent agreement carefully before deciding whether to participate in this experiment.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
		Purpose of the research:
		To examine the way people reason about causes and effects.
	</p>

	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
		What you will do in this research:
		Images will be shown to you and you will have to enter answers on a sliding scale.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>

		Time required:
		Participation will take about 25 minutes to complete.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
		Risks:
		There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study. The effects of participating should be comparable to those you would experience from viewing a computer monitor for 25 minutes and using a mouse or keyboard.
	</p>
	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
		Benefits:
		This study provides no benefits to you individually. The study provides important information about how people reason about causes and effects. This has potential implications for public domains, such as healthcare and the justice system, where understanding the processes governing causal attribution (e.g. did a health care policy reduce the risk of cancer, or does a jury beieve that a defendant caused harm) can lead to more psychologically effective policy.

	<p style='text-align:left;font-size:18px;line-height:29px'>
		Compensation:
		You will receive $4.25 on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
